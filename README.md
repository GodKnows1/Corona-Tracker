# Corona-Tracker

An App to track the Person near you. This App was designed in keeping the idea that if the person having Corona is near you you can have a check. 
In this App Firebase is used, you can use your own firebase credentials. And till now you can see the people having the App and the distance rom you but you can make a restrain or put a limit at distance by uncommenting Line no 372 in ListOnline.java

# Changes you can make

If anybody wants to add a feature it can put a Notifications feature in it when the person is near you a notification can rung and also start a service in bg to run this App continuously. I have made file but not integrate with file. If you want you can its MyService.java  
Till now data will be a dummy, I designed this App that hospital will have the database and they can update the structure and data. 
Let me guide you how

# Idea

The idea was that hospital will change in databases the status i.e Fit, Quarantine, Affected and the App while fetching the data will check that the person is near u or not which is not fit else will not show. For now everyone is quarantined by default.If any queries in project you can contact.
